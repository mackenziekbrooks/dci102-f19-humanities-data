## Activity 6

* First, share with your partner one realization you had while learning HTML/CSS. It can be technical like "don't forget that slash" or conceptual "I realized I need to read directions more closely."
* Second, visit each other's new website. Right click/Ctrl + Click to ```view page source```. 
* Proof your partner's code. Check their syntax. 
* Work together to add the following to each of your websites: 
	* an ```iframe``` that embeds another website
	* two ```div``` tags with different background colors (hint, you'll need to use a class or id)

<p>To familiarize yourself with the various methodologies in the DH world, please conduct a review of one DH project. You may select from the list below or find a project of your choosing (subject to professor approval), as long as it uses spatial data as its source. Be prepared to share your review in class. </p>

<p>Because we are short on time, you're not being expected to design and implement a full-scale data-driven project. This assignment asks you to use your imagination about what this project could become. Now that you're familiar with the data, what paths would you like to pursue? How would you introduce this data set to the uninitiated? Think about the "About" pages we've seen during your Methodology Review assignment. </p>
<p><strong>Due Tuesday 11/19/19 by 2:45pm</strong></p>
<p>Specs:</p>
<ul>
<li>1 point for assignment delivery<ul>
<li>on time</li>
<li>300-400 words</li>
<li>publish on your website, submit URL in Canvas.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>1 point for introducing your project: What's the topic? What's the context? What's interesting? What is this data about? (Save technical details for later.)</li>
<li>1 point for listing 2-3 research questions that are scaled and scoped to the data set at hand.</li>
<li>1 point for identifying your disciplinary angle. Are you approaching this project as a historian, a literature person, someone else entirely? Who is your audience?</li>
<li>1 point for including 1-2 scholarly sources that bolster your research question. How does your topic and disciplinary angle fit into the existing scholarly conversation? </li>
</ul>
<h3 id="project-data">Project data<a class="headerlink" href="#project-data" title="Permanent link">#</a></h3>
<p>At the beginning of each unit, you will be handed a messy data set. It is a rare thing to find a perfectly structured and organized set of data in the wild. A major component of your work during each unit will involve turning this data into something usable for visualization or other types of analysis. "Usable," of course, depends on the nature of your project. Ideally, a clean and well-structured data set can serve a variety of uses AND live beyond specific tools or visualization trends. For this unit, you'll be required to source your own data set, either by finding one online or creating one from scratch. For both these situations, it's crucial you keep good notes on how you modified someone else's data or the process by which you created your own. </p>
<p><strong>Due Friday 12/6/19 by 5:00pm</strong></p>
<p>Specs:</p>
<ul>
<li>1 point for assignment delivery<ul>
<li>on time</li>
<li>saved in Box in a zip folder</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>2 points for a text file titled <code>data-assessment-DATE.txt</code> that addresses the following:<ul>
<li>What makes this a "humanities" data set?</li>
<li>What is the source of your data? Do you have the correct permissions/rights to use it?</li>
<li>What is the spatial component to your data set? </li>
<li>What format is your data in?</li>
<li>What about your data might need to be cleaned or adjusted for visualization?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>1 point for a text file titled <code>data-cleanup-DATE.txt</code> with a list of the modifications you made to your data set. Those modifications could include:<ul>
<li>Adding/deleting data to alter the visualization/map.</li>
<li>Correcting erroneous data.</li>
<li>Separating or combining columns of data.</li>
<li>Any external research you may have conducted to find a historical map or add information to your data set.</li>
<li>Any adjustments you made to the mapping platform (ex: changing the base map in Neatline).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>1 point for a text file titled <code>data-license-DATE.txt</code> that includes the following:<ul>
<li>Use <a href="http://opendatacommons.org">Open Data Commons</a> to help you select an appropriate license for your data set.</li>
<li>If using an existing data set, refer to their license.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="results">Results<a class="headerlink" href="#results" title="Permanent link">#</a></h3>
<p>Now that you have some experience creating a usable data set - what can you do with it? What are the results of your research questions? From the tools we have experimented with in class, select your favorite and/or most meaningful visualizations. Next, interpret this visualization. Use "<a href="http://datajournalismhandbook.org/1.0/en/understanding_data_7.html">Using Data Visualization to Find Insights in Data</a>" to guide your writing.</p>
<p>For this unit, your visualization should feature some kind of map. You can use a modern or historical map. Your map can be created from existing data, or you can create a new set of data to layer on to a map. Ideally, your map should be driven by or created from the data. However, if you create a data set from scratch, then you are free to make a narrative-driven map.</p>
<p><strong>Due Friday 12/6/19 by 5:00pm</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>1 point for assignment delivery:<ul>
<li>on time</li>
<li>published on your website. Submit URL in Canvas.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>1 point for creating a map with at least one of the following:<ul>
<li>Historic map layer</li>
<li>10-20 pins or features</li>
<li>Shapefiles of some kind</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>1 point for 300 words interpreting your results.</li>
<li>1 point for indicating the tools/methods used to produce the results. What can the user do to change the appearance of the map and its data?</li>
<li>1 point for commenting on problems/issues with your method, including the comments from your peer reviewer.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="project-documentation">Project documentation<a class="headerlink" href="#project-documentation" title="Permanent link">#</a></h3>
<p>As you have reviewed projects and experimented with various tools, you have found yourself relying on their documentation. Documentation is super important, but it doesn't always get the attention it deserves. Documenting your process, your project, and everything in between helps yourself and others. Ever gone back to a project after time away? Was it hard to remember where you left off? (This will only get worse as you get older). Documentation is a gift to your future self. A detailed description of what you did and how you did it will help your external audience as well. Your work can serve as inspiration or help someone through a similar problem. Last but not least, documentation is a workplace reality. Your boss and your team will want to know what you've been working on.</p>
<p>Your professor is not your audience. Imagine a friend or family member trying to recreate what you have done in this unit using your documentation.</p>

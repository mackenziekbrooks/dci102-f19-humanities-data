### Participation & Engagement
In this class we'll engage with unfamiliar technology and concepts in what is hopefully a supportive, inclusive environment. I depend on you to be an active, prepared member of this course. We have a two hour course block in order to accommodate the hands-on technical work required for your projects, so attendance is essential. That being said, you can demonstrate engagement with the course through a variety of means - not just being talkative in class. You can earn up to 10 points with the following:

* Blog posts (1 point each). You can earn up to 2 points per unit. Topics and due dates can be found on the assignments page for each unit.
* Comments (1 point each). You can earn up to 2 points per unit by commenting on another student's blog post. Comments must be 100+ words. 
* Speakers (2 point each). You can earn up to 2 points per unit by attending relevant speaker events and writing a blog post about the talk and its connection to the class. Relevant speakers will be included on the schedule.

If you're unable to attend class and notify me ahead of time, you can make up your absence by writing 1 blog post on a topic related to the unit. If you must miss more than 15 minutes but less than the whole class period, you can make up your absence by commenting on another classmate's blog post. Posts or comments must be made by the end of each unit. 

Each unexcused absence will deduct 5 points from your final grade.

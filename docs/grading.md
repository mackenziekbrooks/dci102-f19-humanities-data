### Participation & Engagement
In this class we'll engage with unfamiliar technology and concepts in what is hopefully a supportive, inclusive environment. I depend on you to be an active, prepared member of this course. We have a two hour course block in order to accomodate the hands-on technical work required for your projects, so attendance is essential. That being said, you can demonstrate engagement with the course through a variety of means - not just being talkative in class. You can earn up to 10 points with the following:

* Blog posts (1 point each). You can write up to 2 posts per unit. Topics and due dates can be found on the assignments page. 
* Activities (1 point each). You can earn up to 2 points per unit by completing selected activities begun in class. The activity page will indicate which activities are point-worthy.
* Speakers (1 point each). You can earn up to 2 points by attending relevant speaker events and writing a blog post about the talk and its connection to the class. Relevant speakers will be included on the schedule. 
* Blog comments (1 point each). You can earn up to 2 points per unit by commenting on other students' blog posts. Add a bookmark to your Box folder to ensure I see your comment. 

If you're unable to attend class, please notify me before class begins. Each unexcused absence will deduct 5 points from your final grade.

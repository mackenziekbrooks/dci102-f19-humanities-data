# Environment

Just as you might outfit your study carrel with all the essentials, you also need to setup your computer with the right tools. Preparing as much as you can ahead of time keeps you from losing momentum when that new tool you want to try has more dependencies than you expected. 

## Box

Did you know that W&L offers unlimited cloud storage while you're a student? We will use [http://box.wlu.edu/](https://www.wlu.edu/its/how-to/box-faq) to share course materials, including some of your assignments and project data. Please take some time to familiarize yourself with the platform.

One key feature of Box is [Box Drive](https://www.box.com/resources/downloads/drive). This makes the contents of your Box folders accessible via the Finder or Windows Explorer. You will need to install Box Drive on your computer.

**WARNING**: I will be distributing a large zip file via Box. Please do not double click on the zip file within a Box folder. Trust me, it will result in chaos. Copy the zip file to your desktop then double click to unzip the contents.

## Text editors

Microsoft Word or Google Drive are great apps for writing papers. They make it easy to style and present a document. However, to work with text in a programmatic way, or to write code, we need a different app. MS Word adds a lot of hidden styling and other baggage that we don't need. One of the best features of text editors is that they can detect what language you're writing in and highlight the elements in different colors.

There are a lot of [options](http://lifehacker.com/five-best-text-editors-1564907215) for text editors. You're welcome to try on a few before choosing. I use [Atom](http://atom.io/) and [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com), so I recommend you install it for consistency.

## Browsers

You are free to use your browser of choice, but please install either Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox for testing and troubleshooting purposes. Not all browsers are created equal, and sometimes Safari or Edge cause problems.

## Zotero

[Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/) is a citation manager. It operates via a browser plugin so you can capture citation information directly from the web. There is also a standalone desktop app \(and [text mining possibilities](http://papermachines.org/)!\) as well. There's even a plug-in for MS Word that will automatically generate your bibliography.

## Note taking

[Hypothes.is](https://hypothes.is/) is a new framework for open annotation of the web. It operates via a Chrome extension allowing you to make private and public comments on websites. 

If you're a big note-taker, [Evernote](https://evernote.com) is a great option. Available on the web, desktop, or mobile device.

## File naming conventions

Warning: I will be a stickler about file naming conventions. Not simply because it's confusing to receive 15 documents with the title "Paper 1.docx," but because file names matter a great deal for the kind of work we will do in this class. We will be dealing with a lot of files and versions of those files. The tools and scripts we will use expect consistency.

Guidelines:

* Avoid spaces, use dashes if you must. 
* camelCase is also an option. 
* Include your last name or W&L user name.
* Format dates as such YYYY-MM-DD to facilitate correct sorting.
* Be consistent!!!! 

## Homebrew

[Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) makes it easy to install various packages on a Mac. [Scoop](http://scoop.sh/) is a similar options for Windows.

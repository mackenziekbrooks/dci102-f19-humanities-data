# Unit 1 / Text / Assignments

### Methodology Review

To familiarize ourselves with the various methodologies in the DH world, let's conduct a review of one text analysis project. You may select from the list below or find a project of your choosing \(subject to professor approval\), as long as it uses textual data as its source. Be prepared to share your review in class. **Due September 19, 2019 at 2:45pm.**

	* Appropriate file name (no spaces, includes your last name and the date).
	* Submit in Canvas.
* 1 point for absence of major typos, grammatical errors, and unclear writing.
* 1 point for summarizing the following:
	* What is the goal of this project? Are there guiding research questions?
	* Who are authors? What are their affiliations and roles? Have they received external funding? Are students involved?
* 1 point for describing the following: 
	* Tell me about the data. Where did it come from? How has it been cleaned, modified, or enhanced? How can you tell?

### Research Question

One of the first steps in your project should be to identify your research question(s). What questions do you want to ask of this data? What is your angle? What topics are you interested in? It's important to form a question that you think could be answered by the data we have in the time we have available. It's okay to start small.  

For example, as a librarian, I might be curious about mentions of the library in the Ring-tum Phi. What role does the library play in students' lives and how has that changed over time? Is the library mentioned more around exam time? Does the library get featured by the RTP, or just casually mentioned as a physical space on campus? How did the new library building change the tone or narrative of the library at W&L? 

**Due October 1, 2019 at 2:45pm**

Specs:

* 1 point for assignment delivery
	* on time
	* 300-400 words

* 1 point for listing 2-3 potential research questions + intro to project.
* 1 point for research questions that are scaled and scoped to the data set at hand.
* 1 point for providing contextual details about the data set. Save the technical details for the project documentation assignment.
* 1 point for identifying your disciplinary angle. Are you approaching this project as a historian, a literature person, someone else entirely? Who is your audience?


### Project data

At the beginning of each unit, you will be handed a messy data set. It is a rare thing to find a perfectly structured and organized set of data in the wild. A major component of your work during each unit will involve turning this data into something usable for visualization or other types of analysis. "Usable," of course, depends on the nature of your project. Ideally, a clean and well-structured data set can serve a variety of uses AND live beyond specific tools or visualization trends. For Unit 1, you'll need tokenized 

**Due Tuesday, October 8, 2019 at 2:45pm** 

Specs:
* 1 point for assignment delivery
	* on time
	* saved in Box.
* 1 point for a zipped folder with your modified/cleaned data set. 
* 1 point for the data assessment activity parts 1 + 2 in a text file or word doc.
* 2 points for a text file titled "data-cleanup-%DATE.txt" with a list of the modifications you made to your data set. Those modifications could/should include:
	* 5 or more regular expressions patterns that have a major effect on your data set. 
	* Changes made to the existing file structure or file names. Did you combine individual issues into years for instance?
	* A list of the stopwords you may have used.
	* A list of the modifications you made using [Lexos](http://lexos.wheatoncollege.edu)


### Results

Now that you have some experience creating a usable data set - what can you do with it? What are the results of your research questions? From the tools we have experimented with in class, select your favorite and/or most meaningful visualizations. This can be a graph, a word cloud, a topic model etc. You can even generate data in one program, then visualize in another. Next, interpret this visualization. Use "[Using Data Visualization to Find Insights in Data](http://datajournalismhandbook.org/1.0/en/understanding_data_7.html)" to guide your writing. 

**Due Tuesday, October 8, at 2:45pm.**

### Documentation

As you have reviewed projects and experimented with various tools, you have found yourself relying on their documentation. Documentation is super important, but it doesn't always get the attention it deserves. Documenting your process, your project, and everything in between helps yourself and others. There are many different forms of documentation, but for this assignment, I'm asking you to document the process by which you achieved your results. This could be how you cleaned your data with Regex or how to import and visualize your data in a text analysis tool. Your professor is not your audience. Imagine a friend or family member trying to recreate what you have done in this unit using your documentation.

	* on your website
	* 150+ words

## Blog posts

You are free to choose the topic of your blog posts, as long as there is a connection to what we're covering in the course. You are encouraged to link to articles or embed relevant images \(with citations!\). If you need inspiration, here are few ideas:

* How would you define your relationship with technology? How has that changed over your lifetime? What are some ways you see societal norms changing due to your generation's relationship with technology?
* What does big data mean to you personally? To your field of study? To your future career path.
* What interesting stuff have you found in _Ring-tum Phi_? Anything that would make a cool research project? Is there a period of W&L's history that you'd like to learn more about? How would you compare that period to today? 
* Respond to the \(controversial\) article "[Neoliberal Tools \(and Archives\): A Political History of Digital Humanities.](https://via.hypothes.is/https://lareviewofbooks.org/article/neoliberal-tools-archives-political-history-digital-humanities/)" This link opens the Hypothes.is sidebar containing public annotations of this article. How would you respond to the article itself? What do you make of the discourse occurring in the sidebar? 
* Check out [The Pudding](https://pudding.cool/). What is it trying to do? Is it working? How does it compare to the more scholarly projects we've looked at? 

Specs:

* Up to 2 blog posts due Tuesday, October 8, 2019 at 2:45pm. \(I recommend spacing them out!\)
* Publish to your own domain. 
* 300-500 words per post.
* Link to outside articles and embed images \(with citations!\), if relevant.
* Watch your tone. You are free to have personality and style, but remember that this is an academic/professional project. Find a balance between Buzzfeed and a scholarly journal.

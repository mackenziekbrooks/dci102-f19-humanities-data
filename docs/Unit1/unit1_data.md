# Unit 1 / Text / Data

## Background

For our first challenge, we will tackle a familiar source: the [Ring-tum Phi Archive](https://repository.wlu.edu/handle/11021/26338).

The Ring-tum Phi \(RTP\) is Washington and Lee's student newspaper, published on a weekly basis since 1897. The RTP is a great source for institutional and local history. It can also serve as a window into the college student perspective on current events. For instance, someone interested in the [history of downtown Lexington](http://historiclexington.omeka.wlu.edu/) can learn more about area businesses by the advertisements. Someone interested in the [co-education decision](http://beyondbowties.academic.wlu.edu/) in 1985 could read op-eds from current students.

But how do you find what you're looking for in the RTP? How do you browse if you don't know what you're looking for? Can anyone access it at any time?

Currently, the RTP is available in several forms. Can you tell what they are from the [catalog record](https://wlu.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/discovery/fulldisplay?docid=alma991000405049704161&context=L&vid=01WLU_INST:01WLU&search_scope=MyInst_and_CI&tab=Everything&lang=en)?

1. The entire run of the print newspaper, bound together by volume, sits in the vault in Special Collections. [See what that looks like.](https://i.makeagif.com/media/8-11-2016/aNVqo7.gif)
2. Most of the entire run is available on microfilm. 
3. The current year of the print newspaper is available to public for browsing. 
4. The entire run of the newspaper has been digitized and is available via the [Digital Archive](https://repository.wlu.edu/handle/11021/26338).
5. Question: how is the RTP being captured now?

## Digitization & OCR

Running a document through a scanner does result in a perfect copy and paste-able version of that document. If you've ever tried to scan a form or print journal article, you might have found yourself battling with an Adobe product. When you scan a document, even if it turns into a PDF, it is an _image_ of that document.

The process by which computer turns that image into _characters_ that can be manipulated is called **optical character recognition**. There are a [variety of OCR tools available](https://github.com/kba/awesome-ocr), however their quality can vary widely.

The RTP was digitized by an external company \(not W&L staff\) in several batches.

## Data set

A zip file of the RTP data set is available in our course Box folder. It consists of text files from each issue of the RTP. Or does it?

# RDF

Resource Description Framework (RDF) extends the linking structure of the Web to use **URIs** to name the relationship between things as well as the two ends of the link (this is usually referred to as a **“triple”)**. Using this simple model, it allows structured and semi-structured data to be mixed, exposed, and shared across different applications.

# RDF 

This linking structure forms a **directed, labeled graph**, where the edges represent the named link between two resources, represented by the graph nodes. This graph view is the easiest possible mental model for RDF and is often used in easy-to-understand visual explanations.

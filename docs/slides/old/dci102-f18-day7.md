# scalable reading
1. start with description
2. barrage with visualizations/stats
3. look for surprises
4. internal comparisons

# computationally tractable questions? 

# explore the data
* where are the patterns?
* what do we expect? 
* what's missing? 
* what can we compare it to?
* where can we find more context? 

# craft your research question
* what topic do you want to explore?
* what questions do you have?
* what questions can you answer with this data?
* with these methods? 
* what can you answer now vs. later?

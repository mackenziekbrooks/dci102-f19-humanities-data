# agenda 
* introduce first assignment
* reflect on learning tech
* HTML/CSS review
* command line! 

# we can all be technical with the right teacher	

# reflection
* What does society say about learning to code? 
* What's wrong with that narrative, if anything? 
* How did I learn to code? How did I feel about it?

# html
* is structured 
* is semantic markup
* is made up of elements/tags
* describes the content

# html syntax
```<tag attribute="value">My Content</closeTag>```

# head vs. body
* ```<head>``` contains metadata, isn't displayed
* ```<body>``` contains the content, is displayed

# classes + ids
* ```<div class="blueBox">Content</div>```
* ``` .blueBox {background-color: blue;}```

# css
* affects the way your page looks
* is a different language/syntax than html
* saves time/ensures consistency
* styles the content

# css syntax
```selector {CSSproperty:value;}```

# unit 0 / activity 5, then 6
As time permits

# break
Please seat yourselves in small groups by operating system. 

# How computers work 
* series of commands
* binary
* layers of abstraction
* humans

# Command line 
* vs. GUI
* container = shell 
* tree structure

# syntax
```$ command parameters -flag ```

* $ says start after me
* command = what to do
* parameters = how to do it
* flag = use this option

# command line crash course

# for Tuesday

* readings 
* practice your HTML or command line!
* start on methodology review assignment (due Thursday)

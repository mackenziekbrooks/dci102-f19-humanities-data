# What is spatial history? 

# the production of space
1. spatial practice
2. representations of space
3. representational space

# what is absolute space? 

# Why is HGIS contested? 

# why do HGIS? 

# Map types 
* narrative maps
* data-driven maps 

# how are maps made? 
* Projections = method for flatting 2D map onto 3D earth
* [The True Size](https://thetruesize.com/)
* [Map Projection Transitions](https://www.jasondavies.com/maps/transition/)
* there will be distortion! 

# how are maps made? 
* Coordinates = geographic coordinate system is agreed upon standard for representing points on earth (latitude, longitude) with a set of numbers/decimals. 
* 37°47'20.2"N 79°26'34.3"W (base 60)
* 37.788931, -79.442863 (decimal degrees)

# how are maps made?
* pins/points
* lines
* shapes
* change over time? 
* tiles 
* layers

# Method review 
* What are the representations of space in your project? 
* Where/what is the data in this project? 
* What are the layers? 
* What is the tech?

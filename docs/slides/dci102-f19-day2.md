# D_H, pp. 1-16
* "humanities" as traditionally text-based disciplines
* "generative humanities" - we're making things now
* digitization of print cultural record > changes learning
* digital environment brings new conventions, need for standards, and a focus on design
* DH not a replacement for "traditional knowledge skills and methods"
* interfaces are important, but they can change, even with the same data

# D_H, pp. 16-26
* computation depends on disambiguation at every level
* core activities: curation, analysis, modeling, editing
* humanistic values affect digital environments/structures
* versioning, prototyping, and FAILURE
* value of humanities? 

# D_H, projects
* [Perseus](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/)
* [Valley of the Shadow](http://valley.lib.virginia.edu/), [Ed Ayers talk](https://livestream.com/wlu/edward-ayers)
* [Women Writers Project](http://wwp.northeastern.edu/)

# "Limits"
* DH suffers from an identity crisis
* DH is overstating the effect the "digital"
* DH makes assumptions and observations that aren't grounded in facts
* DH seeks to make traditional humanities obsolete
* DH tools are only good for "understanding things in mass," they still require a knowledgeable scholar to ask the right questions
* DH should resist and critique the digital

# "Defining Data" + "What is Data"	
* Data is an artifact
* Data can be interpreted as texts
* Data can be computed/processed
* Data is not evidence on its own, but can be used as evidence
* Humanists can use their own skill-set and apply it to data

# When the Designer Shows up in the Design

# 
In the project you reviewed, where does the designer show up? Who is missing from the network? 

# 
In the data for unit 2, who is missing? How can you tell? How can you find out? 

# If you want more: 
* feminist human computer interaction
* discriminatory design 
* universal design
* web accessibility 
* [civil design](http://civicdesign.org)
* [Take Back Collection map](takeback.scholarslab.org/takeback-collection-map)

# activity 7 
* What is my research question or topic?
* What are the biggest problems I have found with the data? What are realistic solutions?
* What methods/tools am I interested in using?
* What resources do I need?
* What are my next steps? Break them down!

# for tuesday
* prepare one visualization + documentation for peer review 
* unit 2 assignments due Thursday

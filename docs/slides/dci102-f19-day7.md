# ICE BREAKER: Favorite thing about fall

# pep talk

# pep talk
* this is going to be messy.
* frustration is a feature. 

# argument clinic
> "Historical questions don’t pop out of thin air, but from a continuously shifting relationship with the past." - Scott Weingart

# scalable reading
1. start with description
2. barrage with visualizations/stats
3. look for surprises
4. internal comparisons

# computationally tractable questions? 

# explore the data
* where are the patterns?
* what do we expect? 
* what's missing? 
* what can we compare it to?
* where can we find more context? 

# craft your research question
* what topic do you want to explore?
* what questions do you have?
* what questions can you answer with this data?
* with these methods? 
* what can you answer now vs. later?

# research question assignment
* due Tuesday
* is not a final commitment 
* requires disciplinary context
* requires scholarly sources

# process 
* decide on date range
* create subset 
* clean dirty OCR
* prepare with Lexos
* visualize with ? 
* analyze results
* repeat!

# Unit 3 / Activities

## Activity 1: Collaborative research

Contribute to a collaborative research document on Box. The final document will be added to the course site as reference for completing the Unit 3 project.

1. In Box, navigate to the ```unit-3-maps/Research Collab``` folder. Create a new Box note for your team based on the ```Template``` Box note. 
2. Phase 1: Gathering. Work as a group to add resources to every category listed below. Add anything you think looks useful. 
3. Phase 2: Refining. Open the next table's Boxnote and review the findings of the group. If there's a resource that your group also found, copy it to the master document in Box. 
4. Phase 3: Annotating. In the `MasterMappingResearch`, claim 1 resource and 1 glossary term by putting your initials in front of it. Write 1-2 sentence annotation summarizing that resource and arguing for its presence on the list. For example: "This tutorial covers the process of geoprectifying a historical map. It was created as part of a workshop on digital history by a history professor." 

### Where to Look

* Scour our readings + project websites
* Check out DH aggregators like:
  * [DH+lib](http://acrl.ala.org/dh/)
  * Digital Humanities Now
  * DH journals
  * DH centers \(Scholars' Lab, Stanford, Richmond, etc.\)
* Informed Googling
* Use info from other courses/experiences
* Ask your network

Categories:

* Projects
* Tools
* Tutorials
* Data sources
* Map sources
* Readings
* Glossary

Evaluate:

* When was it created? 
* Who created it? Why should we trust them?
* What tech is required? Mac or PC? Web app or desktop app? 
* Designed for scholars or business? 
* Size/scope. Is this a big data set? A long tutorial?

## Activity 2: Data assessment

* What makes this a "humanities" data set?
* What is the source of your data? Do you have the correct permissions/rights to use it?
* What is the spatial component to your data set?
* What format is your data in?
* What about your data might need to be cleaned or adjusted for visualization?
* Do you have a mapping/visualization tool in mind?

## Activity 3: Mapping tools

First, take this [survey](https://forms.gle/bJmQxjnXWbD1CZR68) to produce sample data. It will be made available in Box in the Unit 3 folder. 

In your group, review and test out one of the following mapping tools. Compile your findings in a Box note in our Unit 3 folder. 

* Palladio
* ArcGIS Online
* Google My Maps
* Tableau Public

***

* Who created this tool? Is it open source? Is it free?
* How do I use it? Browser or download? OS preference?
* How do I add data? What formats does it accept? 
* How do I add layers? 
* How do I add shapes or pins? 
* Can I add a historical map? How? 
* Where is the basemap from? \(Google, OpenStreetMap, etc.\) Can I change it? 
* What type of mapping project would suit this tool? 
* Can you find the documentation? Other tutorials? 
* Using the sample data provided in Box, create a map of the hometowns. You may need to alter the data to fit the requirements of the mapping tool.  

## Activity 4: Peer review


1. This peer review activity is focused on your project narrative and corresponding map.
2. Read your partner's project narrative and take time to explore their map. 
3. Consider the following 
  * Is the narrative well-articulated? Can you find the research questions? What discipline are they coming from?
  * Does the map work - both technically and conceptually? Has your partner used their chosen platform to its full potential to answer their research questions?
  * If you've used that platform, do you have any tips? 
4. Share your findings with your partner.

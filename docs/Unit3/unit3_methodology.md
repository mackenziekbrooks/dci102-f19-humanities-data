# Unit 3 / Methodology

In this unit, we will explore how spatial visualizations affect our understanding of a cultural object or process, be it a novel like Mrs. Dalloway or an historical event like Emancipation. How do you visualize movement in space using good design principles? How do you map fictional places?

Students will have the option of working with existing data sets from this course, or selecting a new data set \(subject to professor approval\). Now that we have worked through the project management cycle twice, students will be expected to assemble their projects independently. They will research mapping methodology and tools, design the project, create a clean data set, and assemble the project.

## Spatial data basics

* Raster data = layers historical maps or photographs
  * [http://mapwarper.net/](http://mapwarper.net/)
  * .TIFF or .JPG
* Vector data = layers points, lines, or polygons
  * KML \(Keyhole Markup Language\)
  * SVG \(form of XML\)
  * Shapefiles \(.shp, .shx, .dbf\) mostly open standard by ESRI \(Environmental Systems Research Institute\)
  * GeoJSON = shapes + geocoordinates

<p>To familiarize ourselves with the various methodologies in the DH world, let's conduct a review of one DH project. You may select from the list below or find a project of your choosing (subject to professor approval), as long as it uses network data as its source. Be prepared to share your review in class. </p>

<h3 id="research-question">Research Question<a class="headerlink" href="#research-question" title="Permanent link">#</a></h3>
<p>One of the first steps in your project should be to identify your research question(s). WHat questions do you want to ask of this data? What is your angle? What topics are you interested in? It's important to form a question that you think could be answered by the data we have in the time we have available. It's okay to start small.</p>
<p><strong>Due October 30, 2018 at 2:45pm</strong> </p>
<p>Specs:</p>
<ul>
<li>1 point for assignment delivery<ul>
<li>on time</li>
<li>300-400 words</li>
<li>publish on your website, submit URL in Canvas.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>1 point for introducing your project: What's the topic? What's the context? What's interesting? What is this data about? (Save technical details for later.)</li>
<li>1 point for listing 2-3 research questions that are scaled and scoped to the data set at hand.</li>
<li>1 point for identifying your disciplinary angle. Are you approaching this project as a historian, a literature person, someone else entirely? Who is your audience?</li>
<li>1 point for including 1-2 scholarly sources that bolster your research question. How does your topic and disciplinary angle fit into the existing scholarly conversation? </li>
</ul>
<h3 id="project-data">Project data<a class="headerlink" href="#project-data" title="Permanent link">#</a></h3>
<p>At the beginning of each unit, you will be handed a messy data set. It is a rare thing to find a perfectly structured and organized set of data in the wild. A major component of your work during each unit will involve turning this data into something usable for visualization or other types of analysis. "Usable," of course, depends on the nature of your project. Ideally, a clean and well-structured data set can serve a variety of uses AND live beyond specific tools or visualization trends. </p>
<p><strong> Due Tuesday, November 6, 2018 at 2:45pm</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>1 point for assignment delivery<ul>
<li>on time</li>
<li>saved in Box.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>1 point for a zipped folder with your modified/cleaned data set in <code>.csv</code> or <code>.xlsx</code> format.</li>
<li>1 point for a text file title "data-assessment-DATE.txt" with the results of our in-class activity (Unit 2 / Activity 4 Data Assessment).</li>
<li>2 points for a text file titled "data-cleanup-DATE.txt" with a list of the modifications you made to your data set. Those modifications could include:<ul>
<li>All fields should be standardized to the most appropriate data type (Date, String, etc.)</li>
<li>Separation into multiple csv files for more specific analysis.</li>
<li>Any approaches for standardizing the content of the fields (LastName, FirstName or First, Last; separating or combining fields).</li>
<li>A list of cleanup steps taken in OpenRefine or Excel.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="results">Results<a class="headerlink" href="#results" title="Permanent link">#</a></h3>
<p>Now that you have some experience creating a usable data set - what can you do with it? What are the results of your research questions? From the tools we have experimented with in class, select your favorite and/or most meaningful visualizations. This can be a graph, a word cloud, a topic model etc. You can even generate data in one program, then visualize in another. Next, interpret this visualization. Use "<a href="http://datajournalismhandbook.org/1.0/en/understanding_data_7.html">Using Data Visualization to Find Insights in Data</a>" to guide your writing.</p>
<p><strong> Due Tuesday, November 6, 2018 at 2:45pm</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>1 point for assignment delivery:<ul>
<li>on time</li>
<li>published on your website.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>1 point for 1-3 visualizations.</li>
<li>1 point for 300 words interpreting your results.</li>
<li>1 point for indicating the tools/methods used to produce the results.</li>

</ul>
<h3 id="documentation">Documentation<a class="headerlink" href="#documentation" title="Permanent link">#</a></h3>
<p>As you have reviewed projects and experimented with various tools, you have found yourself relying on their documentation. Documentation is super important, but it doesn't always get the attention it deserves. Documenting your process, your project, and everything in between helps yourself and others. There are many different forms of documentation, but for this assignment, I'm asking you to document the process by which you achieved your results. This could be how you cleaned your data with Regex or how to import and visualize your data in a text analysis tool. Your professor is not your audience. Imagine a friend or family member trying to recreate what you have done in this unit using your documentation.</p>
<p><strong> Due Tuesday, November 6, 2018 at 2:45pm</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>1 point for on time delivery<ul>
<li>on your website</li>
<li>150+ words</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>1 point for well structured documentation (headings, bullet points).</li>
<li>1 point for screenshots, links, or other visual material.</li>
<li>1 point for clear, jargon-free writing.</li>
<li>1 point for comprehensiveness and appropriate details.</li>

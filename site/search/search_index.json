I have started many new websites because I got tired of the cutesy name. Your chosen name may be taken, so consider ways to make it unqiue. Be sure to check the box for WHOIS privacy so that your personal information is kept private. Leave the nameserver section as is. Fill out the payment details to complete registration. Important! Be sure to save the confirmation email as it will contain your username and password to access the backend of your site. You will definitely need this in the future. Add your URL to the Box note in our shared data folder in Box. Activity 2: Install Wordpress Login to the Cpanel for your domain by adding /cpanel to the end of your URL. Use the username and password sent to you by Reclaim Hosting. You should see a Wordpress icon near the top of the page. Click on it to begin installing Wordpress. Find the \"install this application\" button. Work through the installation. You can leave the default settings except for the following: Directory - since you might want to use this domain for other things, let's put course materials in a subdirectory, such as http://www.mackenziekbrooks.info/dci102 . Change the administrator username and password to something you are likely to remember. Customize the website title and tagline. Press install to finish up. You should now be able to access your wordpress admin interface by appending /wp-admin to your selected URL. Activity 3: HTML Open your favorite text editor and using the W3 Schools as a guide, write your own HTML document. Save the file as index.html in your Box folder in a separate folder titled: activity_2016-09-13 . I'm not grading this, but it will help me troubleshoot if necessary.

Link the style.css file to your HTML document. Consult the W3 Schools to figure out how to do this. Add a background color. Change the border on your table. Add style to your links when you hover over them. Activity 5: Publish your website (1 point) When you opened your HTML files in your browser, you were viewing your files locally. Only you could see them on your computer. Now it's time to upload them to your domain so other people can view them. In CPanel, open up the File Manager. Navigate to the public_html folder. Create a new folder titled activities or something similar. Upload all your HTML and CSS files. Navigate to your equivalent of www.yourdomain.com/activities . What do you see?

Preparing as much as you can ahead of time keeps you from losing momentum when that new tool you want to try has more dependencies than you expected. Make the computer work for you. Box Did you know that W&L offers unlimited cloud storage while you're a student? We will use http://box.wlu.edu/ to share course materials, including your assignments and project data. Please take some time to familiarize yourself with the platform. One key feature of Box is Box Drive . This makes the contents of your Box folders accessible via the Finder or Windows Explorer. You will need to install Box Drive on your computer. WARNING : I will be distributing a large zip file via Box. Please do not double click on the zip file within a Box folder. Trust me, it will result in chaos. Copy the zip file to your desktop then double click to unzip the contents. Text editors Microsoft Word or Google Drive are great apps for writing papers. They make it easy to style and present a document. However, to work with text in a programmatic way, or to write code, we need a different app. MS Word adds a lot of hidden styling and other baggage that we don't need. One of the best features of text editors is that they can detect what language you're writing in and highlight the elements in different colors. There are a lot of options for text editors.

Another protocol that you use, even if you don't realize it, is the Hypertext Transfer Protocol, or HTTP. Your browser uses HTTP to render websites. When you type in http://www.wlu.edu your browser sends out a request to the computer that can serve up all the files at that particular address.

HTML is a set of tags that add structure to documents. When you write a document, you rely on style to indicate something about the text. You might put the title in a bigger font or break up paragraphs with tabs or new lines. Markup languages do this by adding tags around the content you wish to set apart.

Instead, download this file to your Desktop, then unzip/decompress to view the contents. Activity 2: RTP Scavenger Hunt Form teams of three. Each team is responsible for 3-4 topics + \"best of\" topics. In your team's Box note, list your team name, participants, and your topics as headings. For each topic, find the relevant RTP issue in BOTH the Digital Archive and the data set on your computer. Paste in a URL from the Digital Archive AND the filename for the text file in your data set. As you go along, note your observations/frustrations about the data set at the bottom of the Box note. What was hard to find? Why? Where are the inconsistencies? How's the OCR?

In Sublime/Atom: File > Open > select TesseractOCR. If you select the file, then press open, rather than double clicking and entering the folder, you should see all the folders in the left pane. Use Cmd + F to search or the Find menu item. If you select a folder name or specific file on the left, you can search on just that folder/file. Activity 4 Let's practice writing documentation for a technical task. Create a Box Note in Unit1_Text/Activity4 with your name + number. Compose 5-7 steps to complete the assigned task. Remember the best practices we discussed. Include screenshots and links when appropriate. Then, compare notes with another student with your number. How did you do things differently? Different doesn't mean bad/good. Discuss motivations. Finally, compare notes with a student with another number. Pretend you have never done this before! Can you follow their steps? What are they missing? What was helpful? Install Wordpress from CPanel Write a basic HTML page Create a menu in Wordpress Data Assessment Record the answers to all questions in a text file or Word doc saved to DCI102-studentname Box Folder. Part 1 - File structure + command line Using your new found command line skills, let's learn more about the RTP data. Use pwd cd and ls to navigate through the TesseractOCR folder. What is the basic file structure of the data set as you have received it? What about the file names? What are the patterns? Where (or when) do the patterns change? What is the granularity of the text files? Does each file contain one page? Issue? Reel? Volume? Year? Use cat to read a file. Find the manual for cat . What else can you do with this command? What happens when you type ls *.2.txt ? Can you figure out how to list all the file names in TesseractOCR and send them to a text file? Last step: type history and paste your command history into the text file. Part 2 - RegEx Using your new found regex skills, let's start cleaning up some RTP data. In Sublime or Atom, open the TesseractOCR folder so the left pane contains the file structure. Look around for repetitive problems in the OCR. List 5 problems you find more than once. Start testing regular expressions on those problems. List your successful tests. You can use regex101.com if it helps. Answer the following: How would you find large spaces between words? Are there frequent misspellings of common words? (Ring-tum, Rockbridge, Washington for instance). Part 3 - Lexos With your data subset, start exploring Lexos. Use the documentation often!

Part 4 - Next steps What are the biggest problems with the data set? Which problems can you solve? Based on your proposed research question, what are your priorities for OCR cleanup? What's going in your subset of data? Bonus round - script reading Box also contains the folder /tesseractscript with the original scripts used to create the OCRed text files.

You may select from the list below or find a project of your choosing (subject to professor approval), as long as it uses textual data as its source. Be prepared to share your review in class. Due September 20, 2018 at 2:45pm. 1 point for assignment delivery: on time 300-600 words Appropriate file name (no spaces, includes your last name and the date). Saved to your Box folder (DCI102-username). 1 point for absence of major typos, grammatical errors, and unclear writing. 1 point for summarizing the following: What is the goal of this project? Are there guiding research questions? Who are authors? What are their affiliations and roles? Have they received external funding? Are students involved? 1 point for describing the following: Tell me about the data. Where did it come from? How has it been cleaned, modified, or enhanced? How can you tell? What established standards (technical or otherwise) does the project data use? What text analysis methods are at play? What tools are being used? How can you tell? How open is the project? Do they share their data? In what format? Is there public documentation? 1 point for analyzing the following: Does the methodology seem appropriate to the data and goals? Consider the design of the project. What aspects of the project does the design privilege? How does the design affect your understanding of the material?

What questions do you want to ask of this data? What is your angle? What topics are you interested in? It's important to form a question that you think could be answered by the data we have in the time we have available. It's okay to start small. For example, as a librarian, I might be curious about mentions of the library in the Ring-tum Phi. What role does the library play in students' lives and how has that changed over time?

The Ring-tum Phi (RTP) is Washington and Lee's student newspaper, published on a weekly basis since 1897. The RTP is a great source for institutional and local history. It can also serve as a window into the college student perspective on current events. For instance, someone interested in the history of downtown Lexington can learn more about area businesses by the advertisements. Someone interested in the co-education decision in 1985 could read op-eds from current students. But how do you find what you're looking for in the RTP? How do you browse if you don't know what you're looking for? Can anyone access it at any time? Currently, the RTP is available in several forms. Can you tell what they are from the catalog record ? The entire run of the print newspaper, bound together by volume, sits in the vault in Special Collections. See what that looks like. Most of the entire run is available on microfilm.

Obviously, we will not be able to cover them all in-depth. The goal of this unit is to introduce you to text analysis methods and the steps required to assemble a textual data set. Because this is a data-focused course, we are not spending time on digital methods for close reading. But they do exist! Defining methods Word frequency or counting words Word frequency is a good place to start. How many times does a specific word occur in a document? In a corpus? You've probably seen this executed in the form of a word cloud. The more frequently a word appears, the larger the size. For more introduction, check out \"Basic Text Mining: Word Clouds, their Limitations, and Moving Beyond.\" Collocation and context So we have some frequently-used words. What about their neighbors? Are there patterns to the words that appear around our frequently-used words? Where is the document do those words appear? Near the beginning or the end? N-grams For our purposes, n-grams are phrases of a certain length or \"n\". Technically, linguists consider n-grams to be \"a contiguous sequence of n items from a given sequence of text or speech\" ( Wikipedia ). Topic modeling A complex, statistical method for determining the topic or a list of topics of a document/corpus. See Topic Modeling Made Just Simple Enough by Ted Underwood. Topic Modeling tool Sentiment analysis Sentiment analysis is a form of \"natural language processing\" that attempts to determine whether a chunk of text is positive, negative, or some other subjective measurement. As you might imagine, this type of analysis is useful for determining public opinion - be it a brand, political message, or something else that is hashtag-able. Visualizing Twitter Sentiment is a great way to see what sentiment analysis looks like in action. Try #wlu20 to see how the first-years are feeling. Classification and named entity recognition Classification and NER are other methods of \"natural language processing\" that you might encounter. We won't spend much time with them in this course, but you should be aware of the terms. Both are machine-learning methods to figure out if a document or individual words/phrases match a particular model. Classification could be used to determine if an email is spam. NER could be used to extract the names of people or places mentioned in a document. Scattertext visualization tool Tools Lexos This tool from Wheaton College performs some powerful pre-processing of your corpus for text analysis. Wordle Word clouds are a simple way to get started. Copy and paste text from the RTP into Wordle . Voyant Voyant is a popular text analysis tool. It accepts single documents or entire corpora. The number of features can be a little overwhelming, so be sure to check out the documentation . I recommend running Voyant locally so it doesn't stress their servers. AntConc AntConc is another tool for performing linguistic analysis of a corpus. It is definitely powerful, but the results can be harder to interpret. The Programming Historian has a lesson on \" Corpus Analysis with AntConc .\" Google n-gram and Bookworm Google Books Ngram Viewer is a popular tool for visualizing n-grams over time in the Google Books data set. Prof. Brandon Walsh delves into the nuances of the Ngram Viewer over on his text analysis workbook . You can apply the same technology to your own corpus with a took called Bookworm . MALLET and Serendip MALLET stands for MAchine Learning for LanguagE Toolkit. It's a powerful command line tool with many features, including topic modeling. You're welcome to learn more about how MALLET works, but don't worry too much about understanding the statistics behind it. Check out Getting Started with Topic Modeling and MALLET . Scott Enderle's Topic Modeling Tool Quickstart Guide Serendip is a visual interface for interacting with the topic models of a corpus. Using their sample data, you can compare topics across all of Shakespeare's plays. It's also possible to load in your own corpus. Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) NLTK is a Python library containing a number of text analysis tools. If you feel comfortable with the command line or have programming experience, you might want to explore this option. Check out the Steinheil Affair project on GitHub for an example of what can be with NLTK. Evaluation questions What do you think of the results? What's surprising? What's not?

In order to practice using the terminology and methods of network analysis, let's design a network from scratch. Consult Network Analysis Fundamentals for some help with terminology. 1. In your group, select a topic for your network. It should be approachable for all members of your group. Game of Thrones? W&L students? Sports? A novel or TV show? 2. List all the nodes in your network. Do they have types? Do they have attributes? Is this a biomodal or multimodal network? 3. Start making connections or edges in your network. What type of edges do you need? Do the edges have a weight? 4. Think about centrality. Do you have an ego network? How might you start calculating centrality? Activity 2: Special Collections Scavenger Hunt Form teams of 4-5. Create a Box note in Unit 2 / Scavenger Hunt for your team. List your names at the top. In Special Collections, groups will rotate through each collection. You should answer questions by reviewing the material and asking Special Collections staff. For each collection, you'll want to consider: \"where is the network here?\" For your bonus participation point, visit the Stonewall Jackson Cemetery and add a photo to your Box note. Activity 3: Open Graph protocol In this activity, you will semantically enrich your website using Facebook's Open Graph Protocol . As the site says, Open Graph Protocol \"enables any web page to become a rich object in a social graph.\" When you paste a link into Facebook or Twitter and an image and title show up nicely formatted, this is why. 1. Create a new HTML page or find one of your HTML pages from the first week in class. 2. Create a new directory called \"Unit2\" in your domain. (Hint, go to File Manager). 3. Upload your HTML file to this new directory. Copy the URL of this HTML page. Ex. www.mackenziekbrooks.info/unit2/index.html. 4. Visit the Facebook Sharing Debugger and paste in the URL. What do you see? 5. So let's add some metadata! Visit http://ogp.me/ and add the basic metadata fields as listed to your HTML file. 6. Upload this file to your website, then paste the URL into the Debugger again. What do you see now? Activity 4: Data Assessment Using Open Refine, explore your data set. In a text file to be turned in with Unit 2 Data, answer the following: 1. What do the \"Text Facet\" or \"Numeric Facet\" features reveal about your data? Are there outliers that need investigation? 2. Are there columns that should be split or joined? How would you do this in Open Refine (or Excel?) 3. What columns would be best served by the \"cluster and edit\" feature? Why? 4. Which columns need to be modified for consistency? (hint: any date field) 5. Is there research you need to conduct to learn about the people in your data? How will you go about it? Activity 5: Data Generation Fill this out data generation survey to create a simple data set for testing network analysis tools. Data is available as .csv on Box. Using Open Refine, create an edge list. Remove the timestamp column. From the first column after the names, select Transpose > Transpose cells across columns into rows . Select the one column option and title your new column Value . Check the box for Fill down in other columns . Press Transpose . You should end up with two columns where each person's name is listed multiple times, corresponding with their answer to each survey question. Extract your new edge list as .csv to download. Load data into your chosen app for testing. Activity 6: Network Tools In small groups by operating system, download or open the following network visualization/analysis tools. Use our new survey edge list to demo these platforms. Palladio Cytoscape Gephi UCInet (Windows) Answer the following: 1. What do you think of the results? What's surprising? What's not? 2. How about the tool itself? What options do you have? 3. What can you do with the results? 4. What is useful about this tool and type of analysis? 5. Are the visualizations meaningful? Easy to decipher? Why or why not? 6. Compare and contrast tools. 7. Does this tool expose problems with your data? Activity 7: Set Your Intentions What is my research question or topic? What are the biggest problems I have found with the data? What are realistic solutions? What methods/tools am I interested in using? What resources do I need? What are my next steps? Break them down! Activity 8: Peer Review Visualization Individually, spend some time on HelpMeViz and Part 4 of Data + Design . Make a list of the common problems and solutions that both sites present. Share your findings with your group. What did you find in common? Any differences? Do you agree with all the recommendations? Pair up and review your classmate's visualization. Share 1 positive + 1 needs improvement, based on the recommendations from the reading. Documentation Switch partners and check out your classmate's documentation page. Follow their documentation to produce the same result. Take notes on what worked and what didn't work.

Shenandoah Index Some of you may have heard of Shenandoah , the literary magazine associated with W&L. It was actually founded here in the 1950s by a group of students. Now, it's run by Beth Staples published exclusively online. By this point in the course, you will know that not everything is available online. The full text of Shenandoah is not available for free or purchase. None of the journal aggregators have even made the index available. A student worker in Special Collections (thanks Monica Musgrave!) painstakingly typed up the spreadsheets you will work with during the 2014-2015 academic year. Until then, this data only existed in the covers of the print journal. The W&L Library has been pursuing a DH project based on the Shenandoah index and accompanying archival material. Many well-known authors have been published in the literary magazine. Special Collections holds correspondence between Shenandoah editors and names like Ezra Pound, ee cummings, and Flannery O'Connor. This is not a literary history course, but there is a lot to learn about the mid-century Southern literary scene by studying the connections between these authors. To see what others have done with this type of material, check out the Modernist Journals Projects Labs . Thomas Carter Personal Library This summer, Laurel Myers completed an inventory of the personal library of a 1950s W&L Student, Thomas Carter. She created this inventory as the first step in a project about the reading habits of a young literary scholar. You can learn more about this project in the WLUDH GitHub repo . There's a biographical sketch of Carter in a 1980 Shenandoah article available in Box. What can we learn about Carter and his reading or book buying habits through network visualizations? What were popular authors or topics? How did his taste change over time? What genres are represented? Check out this Hathi Trust project, Creating Data , for a model of how to make meaning from library collections. Stonewall Jackson Cemetery If you haven't noticed, Lexington is a major tourist destination for Civil War History. Places like Lee Chapel and the Stonewall Jackson Cemetery attract tens of thousands of visitors a year. In 2013, Leyburn Library launched an online database of those buried in the Stonewall Jackson Cemetery. Carol Karsch (Data and Statistical Support Specialist) collaborated with Lexington resident Tom Kastner to create the database. Emily Crawford '15 assisted with the work of cleaning up the data and the accompanying photos. Press release Stonewall Jackson Memorial Cemetery database This database is a boon to family history and local history researchers. In addition to Jackson, there are a number of other historical figures buried in the cemetery. The Wikipedia page lists a few. You might recognize names like Preston or Paxton from the streets of Lexington. As you scroll through the database, you will notice that generations of family members are buried in the cemetery. Many of these families intermarried and some still reside in Lexington today. In some cases, the parent-child relationship has been noted in the data. The database has some additional information: veteran status, occupation, and birth/death dates. Obviously, having this information available online is a tremendous resource, but what else can we learn about connections between the former residents of Lexington if this data was visualized as a network? How could we enhance the biographical information of these people? President Wilson Correspondence W&L went co-ed in 1985, under the leadership of President John Wilson. As part of her research on the networks of ethical leaders, Prof. Megan Hess, with assistance from Alex Farley '19, has been working on the correspondence of Wilson with his constituents.","title":"Data"},{"location":"Unit2/unit2_data/#unit-2-network-data","text":"For the next two units, students will choose from several different data sets.","title":"Unit 2 / Network / Data"},{"location":"Unit2/unit2_data/#shenandoah-index","text":"Some of you may have heard of Shenandoah , the literary magazine associated with W&L.

There's a biographical sketch of Carter in a 1980 Shenandoah article available in Box. What can we learn about Carter and his reading or book buying habits through network visualizations? What were popular authors or topics? How did his taste change over time? What genres are represented?

Places like Lee Chapel and the Stonewall Jackson Cemetery attract tens of thousands of visitors a year. In 2013, Leyburn Library launched an online database of those buried in the Stonewall Jackson Cemetery. Carol Karsch (Data and Statistical Support Specialist) collaborated with Lexington resident Tom Kastner to create the database. Emily Crawford '15 assisted with the work of cleaning up the data and the accompanying photos. Press release Stonewall Jackson Memorial Cemetery database This database is a boon to family history and local history researchers. In addition to Jackson, there are a number of other historical figures buried in the cemetery. The Wikipedia page lists a few. You might recognize names like Preston or Paxton from the streets of Lexington. As you scroll through the database, you will notice that generations of family members are buried in the cemetery. Many of these families intermarried and some still reside in Lexington today. In some cases, the parent-child relationship has been noted in the data. The database has some additional information: veteran status, occupation, and birth/death dates. Obviously, having this information available online is a tremendous resource, but what else can we learn about connections between the former residents of Lexington if this data was visualized as a network? How could we enhance the biographical information of these people?","title":"Stonewall Jackson Cemetery"},{"location":"Unit2/unit2_data/#president-wilson-correspondence","text":"W&L went co-ed in 1985, under the leadership of President John Wilson.

Once you start, it's hard to stop seeing them. The internet is a network, Facebook is a network, Kevin Bacon is the central node in the Hollywood network. Studying the connections between people and things is a major activity in the humanities, so \"network analysis\" feels like a natural method for working with humanities data. As we saw in Unit 1, we certainly can take statistical and mathematical methods and apply them to humanities data. As we learn about network analysis in this unit, we will consider whether or not we should use it with our data. Defining methods Networks, nodes, and edges A network is, as Scott Weingart says , \"stuff and relationships.\" One piece of \"stuff\" is a \"node\" and the relationship/connection between two pieces of \"stuff\" is an \"edge.\" Nodes are also called points, vertices, or agents. Network analysis Network analysis varies by discipline, but originates from graph theory in mathematics. This is a simplification, but the idea is that one can measure the important nodes in a network by how many connections they have to other nodes and by the weight/significance of those connections. If you're math literate, you can read more on Wikipedia . Social network analysis Social network analysis, or SNA, is used by social scientists to study groups of people, their relationships to each other, and their relationships to other networks. If you want to learn more, Prof. Jon Eastwood in Sociology teaches a course on social network analysis. Network visualization As Franco Moretti points out in \"Network Theory, Plot Analysis,\" the visualization of networks can be more useful to the humanities scholar than formal network analysis. Even if one does not calculate node centrality, visualizing your data as a network can affect the way you interpret that data. Graph database Usually when we talk about databases, we're talking about relational databases. Tables of data are linked by primary/foreign keys. For example, Wordpress creates separate tables (think spreadsheets) for your user info, your posts, and your comments. Relationships are formed by the columns that live in a row together. Graph databases privilege the relationships between units of information. Attributes can be given to the nodes and edges to provide more details. Tools Open Refine Though not a network tool per se, Open Refine is a really powerful tool for cleaning, modifying, and extending your data. Palladio Palladio is a data visualization tool created by Stanford's Humanities + Design Research Lab. It's a browser-based tool that accepts structured data and creates network, geospatial, and gallery visualizations. It's easy to use, but can crash under too much data. Gephi Gephi is a robust network/graph visualization tool. It runs from your computer and can accept large data sets (though you will need some patience). Gephi has a lot of options for changing the appearance of your network via filters and layout. You can also generate statistics about graph density etc. Lots of tutorials here . Cytoscape Cytoscape was designed for the sciences, but is now being used for more general network analysis and visualization purposes. Tutorial by Miriam Posner igraph igraph is a network analysis package for use with R, Python, and C++ UCINET UCINET is available on Windows only.

Online Editor Presentations are written using HTML or Markdown but there's also an online editor for those of you who prefer a graphical interface. Give it a try at https://slides.com . Instructions Markup Here's a barebones example of a fully working reveal.js presentation: <html> <head> <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"css/reveal.css\"> <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"css/theme/white.css\"> </head> <body> <div class=\"reveal\"> <div class=\"slides\"> <section>Slide 1</section> <section>Slide 2</section> </div> </div> <script src=\"js/reveal.js\"></script> <script> Reveal.initialize(); </script> </body> </html> The presentation markup hierarchy needs to be .reveal > .slides > section where the section represents one slide and can be repeated indefinitely. If you place multiple section elements inside of another section they will be shown as vertical slides. The first of the vertical slides is the \"root\" of the others (at the top), and will be included in the horizontal sequence. For example: <div class=\"reveal\"> <div class=\"slides\"> <section>Single Horizontal Slide</section> <section> <section>Vertical Slide 1</section> <section>Vertical Slide 2</section> </section> </div> </div> Markdown It's possible to write your slides using Markdown. To enable Markdown, add the data-markdown attribute to your <section> elements and wrap the contents in a <textarea data-template> like the example below. This is based on data-markdown from Paul Irish modified to use marked to support GitHub Flavored Markdown . Sensitive to indentation (avoid mixing tabs and spaces) and line breaks (avoid consecutive breaks). <section data-markdown> <textarea data-template> ## Page title A paragraph with some text and a [link](http://hakim.se). </textarea> </section> External Markdown You can write your content as a separate file and have reveal.js load it at runtime. Note the separator arguments which determine how slides are delimited in the external file: the data-separator attribute defines a regular expression for horizontal slides (defaults to ^\\r?\\n---\\r?\\n$ , a newline-bounded horizontal rule) and data-separator-vertical defines vertical slides (disabled by default). The data-separator-notes attribute is a regular expression for specifying the beginning of the current slide's speaker notes (defaults to note: ). The data-charset attribute is optional and specifies which charset to use when loading the external file. When used locally, this feature requires that reveal.js runs from a local web server . The following example customises all available options: <section data-markdown=\"example.md\" data-separator=\"^\\n\\n\\n\" data-separator-vertical=\"^\\n\\n\" data-separator-notes=\"^Note:\" data-charset=\"iso-8859-15\"> </section> Element Attributes Special syntax (in html comment) is available for adding attributes to Markdown elements. This is useful for fragments, amongst other things. <section data-markdown> <script type=\"text/template\"> - Item 1 <!-- .element: class=\"fragment\" data-fragment-index=\"2\" --> - Item 2 <!-- .element: class=\"fragment\" data-fragment-index=\"1\" --> </script> </section> Slide Attributes Special syntax (in html comment) is available for adding attributes to the slide <section> elements generated by your Markdown. <section data-markdown> <script type=\"text/template\"> <!-- .slide: data-background=\"#ff0000\" --> Markdown content </script> </section> Configuring marked We use marked to parse Markdown. To customise marked's rendering, you can pass in options when configuring Reveal : Reveal.initialize({ // Options which are passed into marked // See https://github.com/chjj/marked#options-1 markdown: { smartypants: true } }); Configuration At the end of your page you need to initialize reveal by running the following code. Note that all config values are optional and will default as specified below. Reveal.initialize({ // Display controls in the bottom right corner controls: true, // Display a presentation progress bar progress: true, // Set default timing of 2 minutes per slide defaultTiming: 120, // Display the page number of the current slide slideNumber: false, // Push each slide change to the browser history history: false, // Enable keyboard shortcuts for navigation keyboard: true, // Enable the slide overview mode overview: true, // Vertical centering of slides center: true, // Enables touch navigation on devices with touch input touch: true, // Loop the presentation loop: false, // Change the presentation direction to be RTL rtl: false, // Randomizes the order of slides each time the presentation loads shuffle: false, // Turns fragments on and off globally fragments: true, // Flags if the presentation is running in an embedded mode, // i.e. contained within a limited portion of the screen embedded: false, // Flags if we should show a help overlay when the questionmark // key is pressed help: true, // Flags if speaker notes should be visible to all viewers showNotes: false, // Global override for autolaying embedded media (video/audio/iframe) // - null: Media will only autoplay if data-autoplay is present // - true: All media will autoplay, regardless of individual setting // - false: No media will autoplay, regardless of individual setting autoPlayMedia: null, // Number of milliseconds between automatically proceeding to the // next slide, disabled when set to 0, this value can be overwritten // by using a data-autoslide attribute on your slides autoSlide: 0, // Stop auto-sliding after user input autoSlideStoppable: true, // Use this method for navigation when auto-sliding autoSlideMethod: Reveal.navigateNext, // Enable slide navigation via mouse wheel mouseWheel: false, // Hides the address bar on mobile devices hideAddressBar: true, // Opens links in an iframe preview overlay previewLinks: false, // Transition style transition: 'slide', // none/fade/slide/convex/concave/zoom // Transition speed transitionSpeed: 'default', // default/fast/slow // Transition style for full page slide backgrounds backgroundTransition: 'fade', // none/fade/slide/convex/concave/zoom // Number of slides away from the current that are visible viewDistance: 3, // Parallax background image parallaxBackgroundImage: '', // e.g. \"'https://s3.amazonaws.com/hakim-static/reveal-js/reveal-parallax-1.jpg'\" // Parallax background size parallaxBackgroundSize: '', // CSS syntax, e.g. \"2100px 900px\" // Number of pixels to move the parallax background per slide // - Calculated automatically unless specified // - Set to 0 to disable movement along an axis parallaxBackgroundHorizontal: null, parallaxBackgroundVertical: null, // The display mode that will be used to show slides display: 'block' }); The configuration can be updated after initialization using the configure method: // Turn autoSlide off Reveal.configure({ autoSlide: 0 }); // Start auto-sliding every 5s Reveal.configure({ autoSlide: 5000 }); Presentation Size All presentations have a normal size, that is the resolution at which they are authored. The framework will automatically scale presentations uniformly based on this size to ensure that everything fits on any given display or viewport. See below for a list of configuration options related to sizing, including default values: Reveal.initialize({ ... // The \"normal\" size of the presentation, aspect ratio will be preserved // when the presentation is scaled to fit different resolutions. Can be // specified using percentage units. width: 960, height: 700, // Factor of the display size that should remain empty around the content margin: 0.1, // Bounds for smallest/largest possible scale to apply to content minScale: 0.2, maxScale: 1.5 }); If you wish to disable this behavior and do your own scaling (e.g. using media queries), try these settings: Reveal.initialize({ ... width: \"100%\", height: \"100%\", margin: 0, minScale: 1, maxScale: 1 }); Dependencies Reveal.js doesn't rely on any third party scripts to work but a few optional libraries are included by default. These libraries are loaded as dependencies in the order they appear, for example: Reveal.initialize({ dependencies: [ // Cross-browser shim that fully implements classList - https://github.com/eligrey/classList.js/ { src: 'lib/js/classList.js', condition: function() { return !document.body.classList; } }, // Interpret Markdown in <section> elements { src: 'plugin/markdown/marked.js', condition: function() { return !!document.querySelector( '[data-markdown]' ); } }, { src: 'plugin/markdown/markdown.js', condition: function() { return !!document.querySelector( '[data-markdown]' ); } }, // Syntax highlight for <code> elements { src: 'plugin/highlight/highlight.js', async: true, callback: function() { hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad(); } }, // Zoom in and out with Alt+click { src: 'plugin/zoom-js/zoom.js', async: true }, // Speaker notes { src: 'plugin/notes/notes.js', async: true }, // MathJax { src: 'plugin/math/math.js', async: true } ] }); You can add your own extensions using the same syntax. The following properties are available for each dependency object: - src : Path to the script to load - async : [optional] Flags if the script should load after reveal.js has started, defaults to false - callback : [optional] Function to execute when the script has loaded - condition : [optional] Function which must return true for the script to be loaded To load these dependencies, reveal.js requires head.js (a script loading library) to be loaded before reveal.js. Ready Event A 'ready' event is fired when reveal.js has loaded all non-async dependencies and is ready to start navigating. To check if reveal.js is already 'ready' you can call Reveal.isReady() . Reveal.addEventListener( 'ready', function( event ) { // event.currentSlide, event.indexh, event.indexv } ); Note that we also add a .ready class to the .reveal element so that you can hook into this with CSS. Auto-sliding Presentations can be configured to progress through slides automatically, without any user input. To enable this you will need to tell the framework how many milliseconds it should wait between slides: // Slide every five seconds Reveal.configure({ autoSlide: 5000 }); When this is turned on a control element will appear that enables users to pause and resume auto-sliding. Alternatively, sliding can be paused or resumed by pressing \u00bba\u00ab on the keyboard. Sliding is paused automatically as soon as the user starts navigating. You can disable these controls by specifying autoSlideStoppable: false in your reveal.js config. You can also override the slide duration for individual slides and fragments by using the data-autoslide attribute: <section data-autoslide=\"2000\"> <p>After 2 seconds the first fragment will be shown.</p> <p class=\"fragment\" data-autoslide=\"10000\">After 10 seconds the next fragment will be shown.</p> <p class=\"fragment\">Now, the fragment is displayed for 2 seconds before the next slide is shown.</p> </section> To override the method used for navigation when auto-sliding, you can specify the autoSlideMethod setting. To only navigate along the top layer and ignore vertical slides, set this to Reveal.navigateRight . Whenever the auto-slide mode is resumed or paused the autoslideresumed and autoslidepaused events are fired. Keyboard Bindings If you're unhappy with any of the default keyboard bindings you can override them using the keyboard config option: Reveal.configure({ keyboard: { 13: 'next', // go to the next slide when the ENTER key is pressed 27: function() {}, // do something custom when ESC is pressed 32: null // don't do anything when SPACE is pressed (i.e. disable a reveal.js default binding) } }); Touch Navigation You can swipe to navigate through a presentation on any touch-enabled device. Horizontal swipes change between horizontal slides, vertical swipes change between vertical slides. If you wish to disable this you can set the touch config option to false when initializing reveal.js. If there's some part of your content that needs to remain accessible to touch events you'll need to highlight this by adding a data-prevent-swipe attribute to the element. One common example where this is useful is elements that need to be scrolled. Lazy Loading When working on presentation with a lot of media or iframe content it's important to load lazily. Lazy loading means that reveal.js will only load content for the few slides nearest to the current slide. The number of slides that are preloaded is determined by the viewDistance configuration option. To enable lazy loading all you need to do is change your \"src\" attributes to \"data-src\" as shown below. This is supported for image, video, audio and iframe elements. Lazy loaded iframes will also unload when the containing slide is no longer visible. <section> <img data-src=\"image.png\"> <iframe data-src=\"http://hakim.se\"></iframe> <video> <source data-src=\"video.webm\" type=\"video/webm\" /> <source data-src=\"video.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\" /> </video> </section> API The Reveal object exposes a JavaScript API for controlling navigation and reading state: // Navigation Reveal.slide( indexh, indexv, indexf ); Reveal.left(); Reveal.right(); Reveal.up(); Reveal.down(); Reveal.prev(); Reveal.next(); Reveal.prevFragment(); Reveal.nextFragment(); // Randomize the order of slides Reveal.shuffle(); // Toggle presentation states, optionally pass true/false to force on/off Reveal.toggleOverview(); Reveal.togglePause(); Reveal.toggleAutoSlide(); // Shows a help overlay with keyboard shortcuts, optionally pass true/false // to force on/off Reveal.toggleHelp(); // Change a config value at runtime Reveal.configure({ controls: true }); // Returns the present configuration options Reveal.getConfig(); // Fetch the current scale of the presentation Reveal.getScale(); // Retrieves the previous and current slide elements Reveal.getPreviousSlide(); Reveal.getCurrentSlide(); Reveal.getIndices(); // { h: 0, v: 0 } } Reveal.getPastSlideCount(); Reveal.getProgress(); // (0 == first slide, 1 == last slide) Reveal.getSlides(); // Array of all slides Reveal.getTotalSlides(); // total number of slides // Returns the speaker notes for the current slide Reveal.getSlideNotes(); // State checks Reveal.isFirstSlide(); Reveal.isLastSlide(); Reveal.isOverview(); Reveal.isPaused(); Reveal.isAutoSliding(); Slide Changed Event A 'slidechanged' event is fired each time the slide is changed (regardless of state). The event object holds the index values of the current slide as well as a reference to the previous and current slide HTML nodes. Some libraries, like MathJax (see #226 ), get confused by the transforms and display states of slides. Often times, this can be fixed by calling their update or render function from this callback. Reveal.addEventListener( 'slidechanged', function( event ) { // event.previousSlide, event.currentSlide, event.indexh, event.indexv } ); Presentation State The presentation's current state can be fetched by using the getState method. A state object contains all of the information required to put the presentation back as it was when getState was first called. Sort of like a snapshot. It's a simple object that can easily be stringified and persisted or sent over the wire. Reveal.slide( 1 ); // we're on slide 1 var state = Reveal.getState(); Reveal.slide( 3 ); // we're on slide 3 Reveal.setState( state ); // we're back on slide 1 Slide States If you set data-state=\"somestate\" on a slide <section> , \"somestate\" will be applied as a class on the document element when that slide is opened. This allows you to apply broad style changes to the page based on the active slide. Furthermore you can also listen to these changes in state via JavaScript: Reveal.addEventListener( 'somestate', function() { // TODO: Sprinkle magic }, false ); Slide Backgrounds Slides are contained within a limited portion of the screen by default to allow them to fit any display and scale uniformly. You can apply full page backgrounds outside of the slide area by adding a data-background attribute to your <section> elements. Four different types of backgrounds are supported: color, image, video and iframe. Color Backgrounds All CSS color formats are supported, like rgba() or hsl(). <section data-background-color=\"#ff0000\"> <h2>Color</h2> </section> Image Backgrounds By default, background images are resized to cover the full page. Available options: Attribute Default Description data-background-image URL of the image to show. GIFs restart when the slide opens. data-background-size cover See background-size on MDN. data-background-position center See background-position on MDN. data-background-repeat no-repeat See background-repeat on MDN. <section data-background-image=\"http://example.com/image.png\"> <h2>Image</h2> </section> <section data-background-image=\"http://example.com/image.png\" data-background-size=\"100px\" data-background-repeat=\"repeat\"> <h2>This background image will be sized to 100px and repeated</h2> </section> Video Backgrounds Automatically plays a full size video behind the slide. Attribute Default Description data-background-video A single video source, or a comma separated list of video sources. data-background-video-loop false Flags if the video should play repeatedly. data-background-video-muted false Flags if the audio should be muted. data-background-size cover Use cover for full screen and some cropping or contain for letterboxing. <section data-background-video=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.slid.es/site/homepage/v1/homepage-video-editor.mp4,https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.slid.es/site/homepage/v1/homepage-video-editor.webm\" data-background-video-loop data-background-video-muted> <h2>Video</h2> </section> Iframe Backgrounds Embeds a web page as a slide background that covers 100% of the reveal.js width and height. The iframe is in the background layer, behind your slides, and as such it's not possible to interact with it by default. To make your background interactive, you can add the data-background-interactive attribute. <section data-background-iframe=\"https://slides.com\" data-background-interactive> <h2>Iframe</h2> </section> Background Transitions Backgrounds transition using a fade animation by default. This can be changed to a linear sliding transition by passing backgroundTransition: 'slide' to the Reveal.initialize() call. Alternatively you can set data-background-transition on any section with a background to override that specific transition. Parallax Background If you want to use a parallax scrolling background, set the first two config properties below when initializing reveal.js (the other two are optional). Reveal.initialize({ // Parallax background image parallaxBackgroundImage: '', // e.g. \"https://s3.amazonaws.com/hakim-static/reveal-js/reveal-parallax-1.jpg\" // Parallax background size parallaxBackgroundSize: '', // CSS syntax, e.g. \"2100px 900px\" - currently only pixels are supported (don't use % or auto) // Number of pixels to move the parallax background per slide // - Calculated automatically unless specified // - Set to 0 to disable movement along an axis parallaxBackgroundHorizontal: 200, parallaxBackgroundVertical: 50 }); Make sure that the background size is much bigger than screen size to allow for some scrolling. View example . Slide Transitions The global presentation transition is set using the transition config value. You can override the global transition for a specific slide by using the data-transition attribute: <section data-transition=\"zoom\"> <h2>This slide will override the presentation transition and zoom!</h2> </section> <section data-transition-speed=\"fast\"> <h2>Choose from three transition speeds: default, fast or slow!</h2> </section> You can also use different in and out transitions for the same slide: <section data-transition=\"slide\"> The train goes on \u2026 </section> <section data-transition=\"slide\"> and on \u2026 </section> <section data-transition=\"slide-in fade-out\"> and stops. </section> <section data-transition=\"fade-in slide-out\"> (Passengers entering and leaving) </section> <section data-transition=\"slide\"> And it starts again. </section> Internal links It's easy to link between slides. The first example below targets the index of another slide whereas the second targets a slide with an ID attribute ( <section id=\"some-slide\"> ): <a href=\"#/2/2\">Link</a> <a href=\"#/some-slide\">Link</a> You can also add relative navigation links, similar to the built in reveal.js controls, by appending one of the following classes on any element. Note that each element is automatically given an enabled class when it's a valid navigation route based on the current slide. <a href=\"#\" class=\"navigate-left\"> <a href=\"#\" class=\"navigate-right\"> <a href=\"#\" class=\"navigate-up\"> <a href=\"#\" class=\"navigate-down\"> <a href=\"#\" class=\"navigate-prev\"> <!-- Previous vertical or horizontal slide --> <a href=\"#\" class=\"navigate-next\"> <!-- Next vertical or horizontal slide --> Fragments Fragments are used to highlight individual elements on a slide. Every element with the class fragment will be stepped through before moving on to the next slide. Here's an example: http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/#/fragments The default fragment style is to start out invisible and fade in. This style can be changed by appending a different class to the fragment: <section> <p class=\"fragment grow\">grow</p> <p class=\"fragment shrink\">shrink</p> <p class=\"fragment fade-out\">fade-out</p> <p class=\"fragment fade-up\">fade-up (also down, left and right!)</p> <p class=\"fragment current-visible\">visible only once</p> <p class=\"fragment highlight-current-blue\">blue only once</p> <p class=\"fragment highlight-red\">highlight-red</p> <p class=\"fragment highlight-green\">highlight-green</p> <p class=\"fragment highlight-blue\">highlight-blue</p> </section> Multiple fragments can be applied to the same element sequentially by wrapping it, this will fade in the text on the first step and fade it back out on the second. <section> <span class=\"fragment fade-in\"> <span class=\"fragment fade-out\">I'll fade in, then out</span> </span> </section> The display order of fragments can be controlled using the data-fragment-index attribute. <section> <p class=\"fragment\" data-fragment-index=\"3\">Appears last</p> <p class=\"fragment\" data-fragment-index=\"1\">Appears first</p> <p class=\"fragment\" data-fragment-index=\"2\">Appears second</p> </section> Fragment events When a slide fragment is either shown or hidden reveal.js will dispatch an event. Some libraries, like MathJax (see #505), get confused by the initially hidden fragment elements. Often times this can be fixed by calling their update or render function from this callback. Reveal.addEventListener( 'fragmentshown', function( event ) { // event.fragment = the fragment DOM element } ); Reveal.addEventListener( 'fragmenthidden', function( event ) { // event.fragment = the fragment DOM element } ); Code syntax highlighting By default, Reveal is configured with highlight.js for code syntax highlighting. Below is an example with clojure code that will be syntax highlighted. When the data-trim attribute is present, surrounding whitespace is automatically removed. HTML will be escaped by default. To avoid this, for example if you are using <mark> to call out a line of code, add the data-noescape attribute to the <code> element. <section> <pre><code data-trim data-noescape> (def lazy-fib (concat [0 1] <mark>((fn rfib [a b]</mark> (lazy-cons (+ a b) (rfib b (+ a b)))) 0 1))) </code></pre> </section> Slide number If you would like to display the page number of the current slide you can do so using the slideNumber and showSlideNumber configuration values. // Shows the slide number using default formatting Reveal.configure({ slideNumber: true }); // Slide number formatting can be configured using these variables: // \"h.v\": horizontal . vertical slide number (default) // \"h/v\": horizontal / vertical slide number // \"c\": flattened slide number // \"c/t\": flattened slide number / total slides Reveal.configure({ slideNumber: 'c/t' }); // Control which views the slide number displays on using the \"showSlideNumber\" value: // \"all\": show on all views (default) // \"speaker\": only show slide numbers on speaker notes view // \"print\": only show slide numbers when printing to PDF Reveal.configure({ showSlideNumber: 'speaker' }); Overview mode Press \"Esc\" or \"o\" keys to toggle the overview mode on and off. While you're in this mode, you can still navigate between slides, as if you were at 1,000 feet above your presentation. The overview mode comes with a few API hooks: Reveal.addEventListener( 'overviewshown', function( event ) { /* ... */ } ); Reveal.addEventListener( 'overviewhidden', function( event ) { /* ... */ } ); // Toggle the overview mode programmatically Reveal.toggleOverview(); Fullscreen mode Just press \u00bbF\u00ab on your keyboard to show your presentation in fullscreen mode. Press the \u00bbESC\u00ab key to exit fullscreen mode. Embedded media Add data-autoplay to your media element if you want it to automatically start playing when the slide is shown: <video data-autoplay src=\"http://clips.vorwaerts-gmbh.de/big_buck_bunny.mp4\"></video> If you want to enable or disable autoplay globally, for all embedded media, you can use the autoPlayMedia configuration option. If you set this to true ALL media will autoplay regardless of individual data-autoplay attributes. If you initialize with autoPlayMedia: false NO media will autoplay. Note that embedded HTML5 <video> / <audio> and YouTube/Vimeo iframes are automatically paused when you navigate away from a slide. This can be disabled by decorating your element with a data-ignore attribute. Embedded iframes reveal.js automatically pushes two post messages to embedded iframes. slide:start when the slide containing the iframe is made visible and slide:stop when it is hidden. Stretching elements Sometimes it's desirable to have an element, like an image or video, stretch to consume as much space as possible within a given slide. This can be done by adding the .stretch class to an element as seen below: <section> <h2>This video will use up the remaining space on the slide</h2> <video class=\"stretch\" src=\"http://clips.vorwaerts-gmbh.de/big_buck_bunny.mp4\"></video> </section> Limitations: - Only direct descendants of a slide section can be stretched - Only one descendant per slide section can be stretched postMessage API The framework has a built-in postMessage API that can be used when communicating with a presentation inside of another window. Here's an example showing how you'd make a reveal.js instance in the given window proceed to slide 2: <window>.postMessage( JSON.stringify({ method: 'slide', args: [ 2 ] }), '*' ); When reveal.js runs inside of an iframe it can optionally bubble all of its events to the parent. Bubbled events are stringified JSON with three fields: namespace, eventName and state. Here's how you subscribe to them from the parent window: window.addEventListener( 'message', function( event ) { var data = JSON.parse( event.data ); if( data.namespace === 'reveal' && data.eventName ==='slidechanged' ) { // Slide changed, see data.state for slide number } } ); This cross-window messaging can be toggled on or off using configuration flags. Reveal.initialize({ ..., // Exposes the reveal.js API through window.postMessage postMessage: true, // Dispatches all reveal.js events to the parent window through postMessage postMessageEvents: false }); PDF Export Presentations can be exported to PDF via a special print stylesheet. This feature requires that you use Google Chrome or Chromium and to be serving the presention from a webserver. Here's an example of an exported presentation that's been uploaded to SlideShare: http://www.slideshare.net/hakimel/revealjs-300. Page size Export dimensions are inferred from the configured presentation size . Slides that are too tall to fit within a single page will expand onto multiple pages. You can limit how many pages a slide may expand onto using the pdfMaxPagesPerSlide config option, for example Reveal.configure({ pdfMaxPagesPerSlide: 1 }) ensures that no slide ever grows to more than one printed page. Print stylesheet To enable the PDF print capability in your presentation, the special print stylesheet at /css/print/pdf.css must be loaded. The default index.html file handles this for you when print-pdf is included in the query string. If you're using a different HTML template, you can add this to your HEAD: <script> var link = document.createElement( 'link' ); link.rel = 'stylesheet'; link.type = 'text/css'; link.href = window.location.search.match( /print-pdf/gi ) ? 'css/print/pdf.css' : 'css/print/paper.css'; document.getElementsByTagName( 'head' )[0].appendChild( link ); </script> Instructions Open your presentation with print-pdf included in the query string i.e. http://localhost:8000/?print-pdf. You can test this with lab.hakim.se/reveal-js?print-pdf . If you want to include speaker notes in your export, you can append showNotes=true to the query string: http://localhost:8000/?print-pdf&showNotes=true Open the in-browser print dialog (CTRL/CMD+P). Change the Destination setting to Save as PDF . Change the Layout to Landscape . Change the Margins to None . Enable the Background graphics option. Click Save . Alternatively you can use the decktape project. Theming The framework comes with a few different themes included: black: Black background, white text, blue links (default theme) white: White background, black text, blue links league: Gray background, white text, blue links (default theme for reveal.js < 3.0.0) beige: Beige background, dark text, brown links sky: Blue background, thin dark text, blue links night: Black background, thick white text, orange links serif: Cappuccino background, gray text, brown links simple: White background, black text, blue links solarized: Cream-colored background, dark green text, blue links Each theme is available as a separate stylesheet. To change theme you will need to replace black below with your desired theme name in index.html: <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"css/theme/black.css\" id=\"theme\"> If you want to add a theme of your own see the instructions here: /css/theme/README.md . Speaker Notes reveal.js comes with a speaker notes plugin which can be used to present per-slide notes in a separate browser window. The notes window also gives you a preview of the next upcoming slide so it may be helpful even if you haven't written any notes. Press the 's' key on your keyboard to open the notes window. A speaker timer starts as soon as the speaker view is opened. You can reset it to 00:00:00 at any time by simply clicking/tapping on it. Notes are defined by appending an <aside> element to a slide as seen below. You can add the data-markdown attribute to the aside element if you prefer writing notes using Markdown. Alternatively you can add your notes in a data-notes attribute on the slide. Like <section data-notes=\"Something important\"></section> . When used locally, this feature requires that reveal.js runs from a local web server . <section> <h2>Some Slide</h2> <aside class=\"notes\"> Oh hey, these are some notes. They'll be hidden in your presentation, but you can see them if you open the speaker notes window (hit 's' on your keyboard). </aside> </section> If you're using the external Markdown plugin, you can add notes with the help of a special delimiter: <section data-markdown=\"example.md\" data-separator=\"^\\n\\n\\n\" data-separator-vertical=\"^\\n\\n\" data-separator-notes=\"^Note:\"></section> # Title ## Sub-title Here is some content... Note: This will only display in the notes window. Share and Print Speaker Notes Notes are only visible to the speaker inside of the speaker view. If you wish to share your notes with others you can initialize reveal.js with the showNotes config value set to true . Notes will appear along the bottom of the presentations. When showNotes is enabled notes are also included when you export to PDF . By default, notes are printed in a semi-transparent box on top of the slide. If you'd rather print them on a separate page after the slide, set showNotes: \"separate-page\" . Speaker notes clock and timers The speaker notes window will also show: Time elapsed since the beginning of the presentation. If you hover the mouse above this section, a timer reset button will appear. Current wall-clock time (Optionally) a pacing timer which indicates whether the current pace of the presentation is on track for the right timing (shown in green), and if not, whether the presenter should speed up (shown in red) or has the luxury of slowing down (blue). The pacing timer can be enabled by configuring by the defaultTiming parameter in the Reveal configuration block, which specifies the number of seconds per slide. 120 can be a reasonable rule of thumb. Timings can also be given per slide <section> by setting the data-timing attribute. Both values are in numbers of seconds. Server Side Speaker Notes In some cases it can be desirable to run notes on a separate device from the one you're presenting on. The Node.js-based notes plugin lets you do this using the same note definitions as its client side counterpart. Include the required scripts by adding the following dependencies: Reveal.initialize({ ... dependencies: [ { src: 'socket.io/socket.io.js', async: true }, { src: 'plugin/notes-server/client.js', async: true } ] }); Then: Install Node.js (4.0.0 or later) Run npm install Run node plugin/notes-server Multiplexing The multiplex plugin allows your audience to view the slides of the presentation you are controlling on their own phone, tablet or laptop. As the master presentation navigates the slides, all client presentations will update in real time. See a demo at https://reveal-js-multiplex-ccjbegmaii.now.sh/ . The multiplex plugin needs the following 3 things to operate: Master presentation that has control Client presentations that follow the master Socket.io server to broadcast events from the master to the clients More details: Master presentation Served from a static file server accessible (preferably) only to the presenter. This need only be on your (the presenter's) computer. (It's safer to run the master presentation from your own computer, so if the venue's Internet goes down it doesn't stop the show.) An example would be to execute the following commands in the directory of your master presentation: npm install node-static static If you want to use the speaker notes plugin with your master presentation then make sure you have the speaker notes plugin configured correctly along with the configuration shown below, then execute node plugin/notes-server in the directory of your master presentation. The configuration below will cause it to connect to the socket.io server as a master, as well as launch your speaker-notes/static-file server. You can then access your master presentation at http://localhost:1947 Example configuration: Reveal.initialize({ // other options... multiplex: { // Example values. To generate your own, see the socket.io server instructions. secret: '13652805320794272084', // Obtained from the socket.io server. Gives this (the master) control of the presentation id: '1ea875674b17ca76', // Obtained from socket.io server url: 'https://reveal-js-multiplex-ccjbegmaii.now.sh' // Location of socket.io server }, // Don't forget to add the dependencies dependencies: [ { src: '//cdn.socket.io/socket.io-1.3.5.js', async: true }, { src: 'plugin/multiplex/master.js', async: true }, // and if you want speaker notes { src: 'plugin/notes-server/client.js', async: true } // other dependencies... ] }); Client presentation Served from a publicly accessible static file server. Examples include: GitHub Pages, Amazon S3, Dreamhost, Akamai, etc. The more reliable, the better. Your audience can then access the client presentation via http://example.com/path/to/presentation/client/index.html , with the configuration below causing them to connect to the socket.io server as clients. Example configuration: Reveal.initialize({ // other options... multiplex: { // Example values. To generate your own, see the socket.io server instructions. secret: null, // null so the clients do not have control of the master presentation id: '1ea875674b17ca76', // id, obtained from socket.io server url: 'https://reveal-js-multiplex-ccjbegmaii.now.sh' // Location of socket.io server }, // Don't forget to add the dependencies dependencies: [ { src: '//cdn.socket.io/socket.io-1.3.5.js', async: true }, { src: 'plugin/multiplex/client.js', async: true } // other dependencies... ] }); Socket.io server Server that receives the slideChanged events from the master presentation and broadcasts them out to the connected client presentations. This needs to be publicly accessible. You can run your own socket.io server with the commands: npm install node plugin/multiplex Or you can use the socket.io server at https://reveal-js-multiplex-ccjbegmaii.now.sh/ . You'll need to generate a unique secret and token pair for your master and client presentations. To do so, visit http://example.com/token , where http://example.com is the location of your socket.io server. Or if you're going to use the socket.io server at https://reveal-js-multiplex-ccjbegmaii.now.sh/ , visit https://reveal-js-multiplex-ccjbegmaii.now.sh/token . You are very welcome to point your presentations at the Socket.io server running at https://reveal-js-multiplex-ccjbegmaii.now.sh/ , but availability and stability are not guaranteed. For anything mission critical I recommend you run your own server. The easiest way to do this is by installing now . With that installed, deploying your own Multiplex server is as easy running the following command from the reveal.js folder: now plugin/multiplex . socket.io server as file static server The socket.io server can play the role of static file server for your client presentation, as in the example at https://reveal-js-multiplex-ccjbegmaii.now.sh/ . (Open https://reveal-js-multiplex-ccjbegmaii.now.sh/ in two browsers. Navigate through the slides on one, and the other will update to match.) Example configuration: Reveal.initialize({ // other options... multiplex: { // Example values. To generate your own, see the socket.io server instructions. secret: null, // null so the clients do not have control of the master presentation id: '1ea875674b17ca76', // id, obtained from socket.io server url: 'example.com:80' // Location of your socket.io server }, // Don't forget to add the dependencies dependencies: [ { src: '//cdn.socket.io/socket.io-1.3.5.js', async: true }, { src: 'plugin/multiplex/client.js', async: true } // other dependencies... ] It can also play the role of static file server for your master presentation and client presentations at the same time (as long as you don't want to use speaker notes). (Open https://reveal-js-multiplex-ccjbegmaii.now.sh/ in two browsers. Navigate through the slides on one, and the other will update to match. Navigate through the slides on the second, and the first will update to match.) This is probably not desirable, because you don't want your audience to mess with your slides while you're presenting. ;) Example configuration: Reveal.initialize({ // other options... multiplex: { // Example values. To generate your own, see the socket.io server instructions. secret: '13652805320794272084', // Obtained from the socket.io server. Gives this (the master) control of the presentation id: '1ea875674b17ca76', // Obtained from socket.io server url: 'example.com:80' // Location of your socket.io server }, // Don't forget to add the dependencies dependencies: [ { src: '//cdn.socket.io/socket.io-1.3.5.js', async: true }, { src: 'plugin/multiplex/master.js', async: true }, { src: 'plugin/multiplex/client.js', async: true } // other dependencies... ] }); MathJax If you want to display math equations in your presentation you can easily do so by including this plugin. The plugin is a very thin wrapper around the MathJax library. To use it you'll need to include it as a reveal.js dependency, find our more about dependencies here . The plugin defaults to using LaTeX but that can be adjusted through the math configuration object. Note that MathJax is loaded from a remote server. If you want to use it offline you'll need to download a copy of the library and adjust the mathjax configuration value. Below is an example of how the plugin can be configured. If you don't intend to change these values you do not need to include the math config object at all. Reveal.initialize({ // other options ... math: { mathjax: 'https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/mathjax/2.7.0/MathJax.js', config: 'TeX-AMS_HTML-full' // See http://docs.mathjax.org/en/latest/config-files.html }, dependencies: [ { src: 'plugin/math/math.js', async: true } ] }); Read MathJax's documentation if you need HTTPS delivery or serving of specific versions for stability. Installation The basic setup is for authoring presentations only. The full setup gives you access to all reveal.js features and plugins such as speaker notes as well as the development tasks needed to make changes to the source. Basic setup The core of reveal.js is very easy to install. You'll simply need to download a copy of this repository and open the index.html file directly in your browser. Download the latest version of reveal.js from https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/releases Unzip and replace the example contents in index.html with your own Open index.html in a browser to view it Full setup Some reveal.js features, like external Markdown and speaker notes, require that presentations run from a local web server. The following instructions will set up such a server as well as all of the development tasks needed to make edits to the reveal.js source code. Install Node.js (4.0.0 or later) Clone the reveal.js repository sh $ git clone https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js.git Navigate to the reveal.js folder sh $ cd reveal.js Install dependencies sh $ npm install Serve the presentation and monitor source files for changes sh $ npm start Open http://localhost:8000 to view your presentation You can change the port by using npm start -- --port=8001 .
